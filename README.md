## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= v16
- Yarn or npm
- Hardhat or Truffle for smart contract development
- Solidity >= 0.8.x

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rajeebkm/EquitoX.git
   cd EquitoX
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Compile the smart contracts:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

4. Deploy to local or test network:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network_name>
   ```

## Lending & Borrowing

### Lend Assets

To lend an asset:

1. Deposit tokens into the protocol.
2. Receive interest-bearing tokens representing your deposit.

Example:

```js
await lendingContract.deposit(assetAddress, amount);
```

### Borrow Assets

To borrow an asset:

1. Provide supported collateral.
2. Borrow up to your collateral limit.

Example:

```js
await lendingContract.borrow(assetAddress, collateralAmount);
```

### Repay Loans

To repay your borrowed assets:

```js
await lendingContract.repay(assetAddress, borrowAmount);
```

### Interest Rates

Interest rates are dynamic, adjusting based on the utilization of each asset in the lending pool.

## Swap

EquitoX includes a token swap feature, enabling users to exchange tokens efficiently within the protocol.

### How to Swap Tokens

1. Approve the tokens for swapping.
2. Use the `swap` function to exchange tokens.

Example:

```js
await swapContract.swap(inputTokenAddress, outputTokenAddress, amount);
```

## Staking

Users can stake tokens in the staking pool to earn rewards.

### Staking Process

1. Deposit tokens to the staking contract.
2. Earn staking rewards over time.

Example:

```js
await stakingContract.stake(stakingTokenAddress, amount);
```

Rewards can be claimed or left to accumulate.

## Yield Farming

Yield farming allows users to provide liquidity and earn rewards.

### Steps to Participate in Yield Farming

1. Add liquidity to the supported pool.
2. Stake your LP tokens in the yield farming contract.
3. Earn yield farming rewards over time.

Example:

```js
await farmingContract.stakeLP(lpTokenAddress, amount);
```

## Contract Architecture

- **LendingContract**: Manages the lending, borrowing, and collateral mechanics.
- **SwapContract**: Provides token swapping functionality.
- **StakingContract**: Manages staking deposits and reward distribution.
- **FarmingContract**: Handles yield farming and liquidity rewards.
